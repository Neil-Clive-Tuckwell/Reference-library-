# Upload Instructions for Reference Library

## Files to Upload

From /home/claude/reference-library-prep/:

1. README.md → (root of repo)
2. GASD.pdf → (root of repo for now, can organize into folders later)

## Steps

1. Navigate to https://github.com/Neil-Clive-Tuckwell/Reference-library-
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag both files (README.md and GASD.pdf)
4. Commit with message: "Initial commit: GASD paper and README"

## After Upload

The raw URL for GASD.pdf will be:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neil-Clive-Tuckwell/Reference-library-/main/GASD.pdf

Paste that URL back to Claude to test fetch capability.

## Future Structure (optional)

Once validated, can organize as:
- /frameworks/ (GASD, TRO, Circuit-Completion, etc.)
- /domains/ (biology, materials, fluids, cosmology)
- /foundation/ (core methodological papers)

But start minimal - test fetch first, then optimize structure.
